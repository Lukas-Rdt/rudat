  "indexProjectDesc": "Terror Nightmare Towers is a game based on the board game Santorini, but set in an apocalyptic world, completely changing the setting. Instead of competing for victory on an idyllic island, players find themselves in the remnants of Earth, where resources are scarce. Here, the conflict is not among island inhabitants but between the last human forces and the zombie army. No gods are called upon for help - they have long abandoned us. Instead, we must rely on the abilities of the powers within our ranks.",
