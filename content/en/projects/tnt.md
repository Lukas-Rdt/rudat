# Terror Nightmare Towers

<div class="w-full flex justify-center">
<div class="w-2/3">
Terror Nightmare Towers (TNT) is a strategic board game that transports players into a dark and apocalyptic world. In this variation of the classic game Santorini, players don't build idyllic island buildings but instead erect steel towers in a nightmarish environment. Players take on the role of either the last human faction or the zombie army, maneuvering their figures through shadowy lands, striving to raise their towers into the night sky.

The objective of the game is to move your figure to the top of a three-tiered tower. Each player has the option to either add a building block or move their figure to an adjacent building space, strategically improving their position and obstructing opponents. However, caution is advised: every move can mean victory or defeat, as tower construction requires both tactical skill and foresight.

Every tower constructed by the players symbolizes their power and influence in this dark world. In addition to regular building actions, TNT also introduces special abilities available to the characters, significantly influencing gameplay. These abilities, wielded by high-ranking individuals of each faction, can be used to thwart enemy plans, maximize personal advantages, and secure dominance in the Terror Nightmare Towers.

Similar to the original, TNT can be played with up to four players in three different modes:

- 1 v 1
- 1 v 1 v 1
- 2 v 2

            In this variant, players can choose between the Army and Zombie factions. However, this choice only results in visual differences and does not affect gameplay. <br />
            The game pieces differ depending on the chosen theme, and for some customization four player or team colors can be chosen.

            The tower sections also differ between themes. While the Army Theme focuses on expanding a base rather than building upwards like a classic tower, the Zombie Theme aims to occupy increasingly relevant locations for the remaining humans.
